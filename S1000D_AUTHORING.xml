Chapter 3.9.3
Authoring - Warnings, cautions and notes

S1000D-A-20-10-0000-00C-024C-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 General

Definitions and rules for warnings, cautions and notes are given here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Warnings

Warnings are used in data modules and technical publications to alert the user that possible
hazards are associated with the materials/processes/procedures/limits. These can cause death
or injury in any form if the instructions in the operational or procedural task are not followed
precisely. Warnings describe the hazards and the possible impact.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 Cautions

Cautions are used in data modules and technical publications to alert the user that damage to
the Product is possible if the instructions in the operational or procedural task are not followed
precisely. Cautions describe the hazards and possible impact.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 Notes

Notes are used in data modules and technical publications to provide the user with additional
information, which is helpful but does not belong to the immediate subject. Operational and
procedural tasks can be made easier by the use of notes, but when used, they do not take the
place of operational or procedural information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4 Safety conditions

Warnings and cautions that apply to the whole instruction must be contained or referenced in
the Preliminary requirements - Safety conditions. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.9.
Warnings must precede cautions, and cautions must precede notes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5 General warnings, cautions and notes

Warnings cautions and notes that apply to the Product or part thereof can be captured in
descriptive data modules using the information code 012 (General warnings and cautions and
related safety data).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.6 Presentation

Examples of the presentation of warnings, cautions and notes are given in Chap 6.2.2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Content

Warnings and cautions can be located:
- in one or more separate descriptive data modules using the information code 012 in the
data module code. Refer to Para 1.5.
- in Preliminary requirements (element <preliminaryRqmts>) - Safety conditions
(element <reqSafety>) of a procedural data module. Refer to Para 1.4.
- within operational and maintenance procedures at the element level of a data module.
Warnings and cautions must be placed directly preceding the paragraph to which they
pertain.
- in an internal collection (within the data module using the element 
<warningsAndCautions>) or in an external collection (referring to a common
information repository using the element <warningsAndCautionsRef>). Refer to Para 2.4.

Notes can be placed either before or after the paragraph to which they pertain or in the
Preliminary requirements - Safety conditions of a procedural data module. Refer to Para 1.4.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00030 - Use of general warnings, cautions and
notes as separate data modules:
– Decide whether to produce general warnings, cautions and notes in separate descriptive
data modules.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00031 - Use of warning and/or caution
collections:
– Decide whether to use warning and/or caution collections, internal or external.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2.1 Warnings
  
Description: The element <warning> is used to contain hazard information that can cause
personal injury or death.
Warnings in data modules must always precede the text where the hazard arises (for details
see below) and must always precede cautions and notes.

Warnings of a general nature which are applicable throughout a procedure can precede the
instruction to save repeating the warning before each of the individual steps of the maintenance
task where the hazard arises. Refer to Para 2.1.2.

The default heading WARNING must begin the warning followed by symbols, if any. Refer to
Chap 6.2.2 for examples.

Note
  The default heading WARNING is not entered in the data modules when data modules are
  written in an XML editor or a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)-editor with an
  automatic function for presentation of legends. If not, the author must make sure that the
  default heading is included.

Warnings must not be numbered. Warnings must be the first item within that step/para.

Note
  There are two methods to present warnings. Refer to Chap 6.2.2.

Note
  Warnings must not be used for purely descriptive information (eg, data modules with
  information code 040). This does not prohibit the use of warnings in a descriptive data
  module for the production of content such as a summary of warnings.

Note

2.2 Cautions

Description: The element <caution> contains hazard information that can cause damage
to the Product.

Cautions in data modules must always precede the text where the hazard arises and must
always precede notes.

Cautions of a general nature, however, which are applicable throughout an instruction, can
precede the instruction to save repeating the caution before each of the individual steps of the
maintenance task where the hazard arises. Refer to Para 2.1.2.
  
The default heading CAUTION must begin the caution followed by symbols, if any. Refer to
Chap 6.2.2 for examples.

Note
  The default heading CAUTION is not entered in the data modules when data modules are
  written in an XML editor or a WYSIWYG-editor with an automatic function for presentation
  of legends. If not, the author must make sure that the default heading is included.

Cautions must not be numbered. Cautions must be the first item within that step/para if there
are no warnings, because warnings must always precede cautions.
  
The scope of cautions follows the same rules as for warnings. Refer to Para 2.1.

Note
  There are two methods to present cautions. Refer to Chap 6.2.2.

Note
  Cautions must not be used for purely descriptive information (eg, data modules with
  information code 040). This does not prohibit the use of cautions in a descriptive data
  module for the production of content such as a summary of cautions.

Note
  Cautions in business rules document data modules are strongly discouraged. The attribute 
  brSeverityLevel must be used instead.

The content of the element <caution> is given by a combination of the same child
elements and attributes as used by the element <warning> except for the absence of the
attribute vitalWarningFlag. Refer to Para 2.1.

  
Markup element: <caution>

Attributes:

Note
  The attribute id is required when authoring a warning and caution collection. Refer to Para 2.4.

- changeType (O), changeMark (O) and reasonForUpdateRefIds (O), the
change indications. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.1.
- cautionType (O), the type of caution
- internalRefId (O), the target id. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.2.
- controlAuthorityRefs (O), the control authority information by referencing the
element <controlAuthority>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.1.
- securityClassification (O), commercialClassification (O), 
caveat (O) and derivativeClassificationRefId (O), the security and
restrictive marking. Refer to Chap 3.6.

Child elements:
- <symbol>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.10.
- <warningAndCautionPara>. Refer to Para 2.1.2.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00034 - Use of the attribute cautionType:
– Decide whether and how to use the attribute cautionType.

  
Markup example:

<caution>
  <warningAndCautionPara>Do not use a
    <internalRef internalRefId="seq-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt05"></internalRef>
    that has high pressure. A water hose that has high pressure can
    cause some parts to become loose or full of water.</warningAndCautionPara>
</caution>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2.3 Notes
  
Description: The element <note> contains additional information that can be useful to the
user.
  
Normally, notes in data modules must follow the text to which they refer. In certain
circumstances, it can be necessary to allow for notes to precede the text to which they refer to.
In this case, projects must declare the use of notes in their business rules.

Notes must always follow warnings and cautions.
Notes of a general nature, which are applicable throughout an instruction, can precede the
instruction to save repeating the note throughout the instruction.

The production of notes as individual data modules is not recommended.
The default heading Note must begin the note. If the notes are numbered, then the default
heading Note X must begin the note. Refer to examples in Chap 6.2.2

Note
  The default heading Note is not entered in the data modules when data modules are
  written in an XML editor or a WYSIWYG-editor with an automatic function for presentation
  of legends. If not, the author must make sure that the default heading is included.

If there is more than one note they can, by project decision, be numbered to enable cross￾references 
to be made to them within the text.
A note can comprise of:
- symbols
- one or more paragraphs
- one or more random (unordered) lists at one level only
- one sequential (ordered) list at one level only

It is however recommended to keep notes as simple as possible.
The use of attention sequential lists and attention random lists is discouraged. Refer to
Para 2.3.2 and Para 2.1.2.2.

There can be instances where notes are applicable to complete steps/paras or substeps/
subparas, including their substeps/subparas. In those circumstances, notes must be the first
item within that step/para provided there are no warnings or cautions. Otherwise warnings and
cautions take precedence. Notes must follow the step/para number and title, if any, and
precede any text.

The scope of notes follows the same rules as for warnings. Refer to Para 2.1.
The content of the element <note> is given by a combination of the same child elements and
attributes as for the element <warning> (refer to Para 2.1), except for the absence of the
attribute vitalWarningFlag and the addition of sequential lists.

  
Markup element: <note>

Chapter 3.9.5
Authoring - Data modules

S1000D-A-20-10-0000-00D-024C-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 General

This chapter gives the user brief definitions to some of the most common XML terms used in
this specification. The markup examples that are included in the chapter are XML markup
examples. For the terminology, definitions and the use of XML, refer to REC-xml-20081126.

The chapter is further broken down to give definitions and guidance on using the XML to create
data modules.

Chap 3.9.5.1 gives the definitions and guidance for the identification and status section of all
types of data modules.

The definitions and guidance for the common constructs and information types are given in
Chap 3.9.5.2.

Chap 3.9.5.3 gives the rules for applicability.

Throughout these chapters, attributes are marked as mandatory or optional. The definitions for
these are:
- mandatory (M) if the attribute must be included in the context concerned, as enforced by
the Schema structure or otherwise
- optional (O) if the attribute is not enforced by the Schema structure, ( ie, can be omitted in
the context concerned )

XML elements are written in Courier New 12 in blue within brackets preceded by the
word "element", (eg, element <applic>).

Attributes are written in Courier New 12 in black without quotation marks and brackets
preceded by the word "attribute", (eg, attribute internalRefId).

Values given in the text are written in Courier New 12 in blue within quotation marks
preceded by the word "value", (eg, value "Value_1").

XML examples are written in Courier New 11 in black.


Example:

<language languageIsoCode="sx" countryIsoCode="US"/><language
languageIsoCode="de" countryIsoCode="AT"/><reasonForUpdate
id="rfu-001" updateHighlight="1"
updateReasonType="urt02">
  <simpleRefPara>The tool set is changed.</simpleRefPara>
</reasonForUpdate>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 XML terminology and definitions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Element

An element is a component of an XML instance, defined by the Schema and is identified in the
document by descriptive markup, usually a start-tag and end-tag.

For example: <para>…</para>. There is also a type of element called an empty element
which does not comprise an end-tag.

  
Example:

<security securityClassification="01"/>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Generic identifier

A generic identifier is a name of an element or "tag-name".

  
Example: The generic identifier of the element <para> is para.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 Attribute

An attribute is a value that can be applied to an element.

Example: The values for day, month and year are numeric attributes of the <issueDate>
element <issueDate day="30" month="07" year="2000"/>.

Attributes are either mandatory (they must be given a value) or optional. Some attributes
require a typed value, while other attribute values are selectable from a list. Certain attributes
have a default value which is applied automatically if a value for the attribute is not specified.

In most cases attributes can have only one allowable value at a time. However, there are a few
attributes that can have one or more allowable values at the same time. When more than one
value is given, the values must be separated by space characters.


Example: Attribute itemCharacteristic can have one value defining the parent
element as related to electrostatic discharge:

<proceduralStep itemCharacteristic="ic02">… text …</proceduralStep>

Example: Attribute itemCharacteristic can also have two values defining the parent
element as related to electrostatic discharge and with a quality assurance effect:

<proceduralStep itemCharacteristic="ic02 ic03">… text …</proceduralStep>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 Tag

The start of an element is marked by a start-tag and the end by an end-tag (unless the element
is an empty element). An element start-tag is comprised of a less-than sign [<], then the
generic identifier, then, if required, a set of attributes followed by a greater-than sign [>].

Example: The start-tag of a paragraph is <para>.

An element end-tag is comprised of a less-than sign [<] followed by a slash [/], then the generic
identifier and finally a greater-than sign [>].


Example: The end-tag of a paragraph is </para>.

In XML markup empty tags are represented like this <security
securityClassification="01"/> or like this <unverified></unverified>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 XML Schemas

The XML Schema controls which elements can appear in an XML instance and in which order.
The Schema also defines the rules for attributes and entities and provides data type constraints
which describe valid units of data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6 Data type string

String data is any character(s) entered between the start-tag and end-tag of an element (plain
text) and characters between quotes that make up the value of an attribute.

  
Example: <para>This is plain text data.</para>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7 Entity

An entity is a character string which, in the final data module output, will be replaced by a
character, symbol or an external file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2.7.1 Character entities

Some characters required for data modules are not available on a computer keyboard, for
example, degrees, fractions and Greek letters. These characters are made available on XML
systems by substituting a character entity for the required character. Most XML systems allow
an inserted character entity to be displayed on the screen as it will appear to the reader. When
entering a character entity, it must be preceded by [&] and followed by [;], for example, in XML,
the characters inserted for degrees [º] will be &deg;.

It is important to remember that, in XML, character entities are case sensitive, so using an initial
uppercase letter will affect the final character shown in the data module.

  
Example: &Sigma; (uppercase S) = Σ, and &sigma; (lowercase letter s) = σ.

  
Table 2 details some of the more common character entities currently in use. For a complete
list, refer to the S1000D data module Schemas.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7.2 External system entities

For illustrations and symbols, a system entity is inserted into the XML instance normally carried
out by the system.

2.8 Use of some special characters

The following rules apply:
- Hyphen [-] is used in the data module code, ICN, publication module code, CSN and as a
separator in normal text, (eg, between the element <techName> and the element 
<infoName> on data module titles).
- Vertical bar [ | ] is used in the markup to separate values and intervals in, for example, the
attribute applicPropertyValues
- Tilde [~] is used in the markup to separate values within a range in, for example, the
attribute applicPropertyValues
- Space [ ] is used as a single space character (using spacebar on the keyboard) to
substitute numbers in, for example, the CSN (Space = ASCII 32 (hexadecimal code 20)).

Note
  These special characters are normally inserted by the formatting application and must not
  to be entered by the author.

Note
  For the entry of XML elements and attributes which can be used as hyperlinks in the IETP
  (eg, CSN, part numbers, NSN), any spaces must be entered from the keyboard using the
  spacebar. Do not use XML character entities for these elements and attributes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.9 Constraints

There are elements in the Schemas that are used under constraints that are described by the
content of their attributes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2.9.1 Constrained element

A constrained element has an attribute, or attributes, that has a value, or combination of values,
which must be unique within the data module. The constraint indicates which attribute, or
combination of attributes, contains the unique value, refer to Fig 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.9.2 Constrained attribute
An attribute, or attributes, that have a value, or combination of values, which must be unique
within the data module, refer to Fig 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.9.3 Unique attribute value
The constraints indicate which attribute, or combination of attributes, must contain the unique
value, refer to Fig 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2.9.4 Constrained element and it attributes
Example
The element <functionalPhysicalAreaIdent> has attributes 
systemDiffCode, systemCode, subSystemCode, subSubSystemCode, 
assyCode, disassyCode and disassyCodeVariant, the combination of which
must be unique within the data module. Refer to Fig 4.

2.1.2.2.2 Information name

Description: The element <infoName> contains the information name describing the type
of information related to the Product about which the data module has been written. It is
recommended that the element is populated with the information code short definition
(corresponding to the attribute infoCode in the element <dmCode>, refer to Para 2.1.1.1).
Refer to Chap 8.4.1.
Projects can decide to modify (or extend) the information name to one that is more suitable,
provided the sense of the information code is maintained. If there is a variation indicated by the
information code variant (the attribute infoCodeVariant in the element <dmCode>,
refer to Para 2.1.1.1), the information name can be extended to describe this variation. Such an
extension can be given by using the element <infoNameVariant>. Refer to Para 2.1.2.2.3.

Example: The short definition of IC 258 is “Other procedure to clean”. A project can have a data module
that tells the reader how to clean with water. Another data module could tell the reader how to
clean with air. In both cases, the information name can be extended from “Other procedure to
clean” (normally IC 258A) to “Other procedure to clean, Clean with water ” (can be IC 258B)
and “Other procedure to clean, Clean with air ” (can be IC 258C).

Note:
  The information name must not contain the characters “&”, “<”, or “>”. These characters
  will cause issues with BREX checking and XML validation.

Note:
  Not all information codes within S1000D will apply to a project. Further, there can be some
  that are defined by the project and some that can be modified. Where this is the case, it is
  recommended that the project compiles a list containing the list of information codes and
  variants that can be used, together with their information names.

Examples:
- Description of how it is made (IC 041)
- Functional test (IC 340)
- Remove procedure, Vertical (IC 520 variant B)
- Remove procedure, Horizontal (IC 520 variant C)

The information code is set to "000" when the SNS gives the function.

Examples:
- Product, General maintenance
- Safety and protective devices
- Fatigue index calculations
- Time limits
- Principal dimensions
- Recovering
- Static stability
- Mass and balance data
- Weigh
- Level
- Handling
- Scheduled servicing
- Product safety

2.2 Status part

Description: The element <dmStatus> contains information about the status of the data
module.


Markup element: <dmStatus>

Attributes:
- id (O), the identifier of the markup element. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.2.
- issueType (O), the issue status of the data module. There are eight values that can be used:
    • "new" - data modules up to and including the initial issue of the approved release
      must have the attribute issueNumber set to the value "000" for in-work versions
      or value "001" for the initial issue and have the attribute issueType set to the
      value "new". Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00030.
    • "changed" - data modules that have been changed and have the changes indicated
      within the data module using change elements and/or attributes, must have the
      attribute issueType set to the value "changed". Refer to default BREX rule
      BREX-S1-00032.
    • "deleted" - deletion of a data modules is treated as a special case of update. The
      data module itself is not physically deleted from the CSDB but marked as deleted by
      setting the attribute issueType to the value "deleted". Refer to default BREX
      rule BREX-S1-00031.
    • "revised" - data modules that have been revised and that contain no change
      elements or attributes must have the attribute issueType set to the value
      "revised". Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00033.
    • "status" - data modules that have had their identification and status information
      updated must have the attribute issueType set to the value "status". Refer to
      default BREX rule BREX-S1-00034.
    • "rinstate-status" - data modules that have been reinstated from a previously
      deleted data module and have only the status information changed must have the
      attribute issueType set to the value "rinstate-status". In the simplest
      case, this status change must require setting the attribute issueType to the value
      "rinstate-status". Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00034.
    • "rinstate-changed" - data modules that have been reinstated from a
      previously deleted data module and have the changes indicated by change elements
      or attributes, must have the attribute issueType set to the value "rinstate￾changed". Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00032.
    • "rinstate-revised" - data modules that have been reinstated from a
      previously deleted data module and have the changes not indicated by change
      elements and attributes, must have the attribute issueType set to the value
      "rinstate-revised". Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00033.

When work first starts on a data module, the attribute issueType is set to the value "new",
while the issue number is set to the value "000" and in-work number to "01", using the
attribute issueNumber and attribute inWork of element <issueInfo>. Then, when
the data module is released, the attribute inWork is reset to the value "00", and the issue
number incremented to indicate approved release of that instance of the data module. 
From issue "002" onwards the attribute issueType must not be set to the value "new" but is to
reflect the release status of the instance of the data module. Examples are shown in Table 3.

2.2.16 Functional item reference

Description: The element <functionalItemRef> contains a reference to the
functional item’s CIR data module.
A functional item can be used to uniquely identify an item that performs a function, 
in a system that is part of a Product.
For example, a functional item can be the third pump in a hydraulic system of a Product.
Depending on the Product instance, this functional item can be mechanical or electrical, and
so, can perform the function of a hydraulic pump.
The functional item is also known as the reference designator.

Identification and status section - Export control

S1000D-A-40-30-0000-00C-024C-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 General

This chapter contains information and guidance on the use of export controls. These controls
are required to contain a statement regarding the regulations that apply to the data contained
within a data module. The controls also contain an indicator that shows which government
gives authority to the regulations defined. This information can be required by companies,
government departments and their delivery systems to control the release of data to authorized
users. In addition, it can be required by authorized users so they can further control transmittal
and use of the data, as required by many export control regulations.
When using export controls, projects must consider the requirements of their statutory
government and the end data users and their data management requirements. Other items to
consider are the display of this data within the user interface. Projects are responsible to
ensure that the export controls applied are correct for the data content and that they comply
with the relevant regulations pertaining to export controls.

Chapter 3.9.5.2.1.1
Common constructs - Change marking

S1000D-A-40-50-0000-00C-024C-D

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 General

Indicating changes to CSDB objects is achieved by using the change markup provided by the
Schemas. The types of changes are insertions, deletions and modifications for elements and/or
text.

Tables, figures and warnings and cautions have special rules. Refer to Para 2.5, Para 2.6 and
Para 2.7, respectively.

Note
  The Data Dispatch Note (DDN) and Comment (COM) Schemas include the change
  markup only within the identification and status section.

With the exception of the DDN and COM, each CSDB object records the reasons for the
changes in their identification and status section. Since reasons for changes are included in all
the explanations of change in this chapter, the subject is explained first. Refer to Para 2.2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Using change markup

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 General rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1 Use limitations

The use of the change markup is limited to indicate technical changes only. Change markup
must only be used to indicate changes since the previous issue of a data module and not
between increments of the attribute inWork. Any changes indicated in the previous issue
must be deleted for the upissue.

Note
  The previous issue of the data module remains stored in the CSDB with the change
  markup at that issue.

Editorial changes must not use change markup. Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00044.

Data modules that have the value of the attribute issueNumber of the element 
<issueInfo> set to "001" and the value of the attribute issueType of the element 
<dmStatus> set to "new" must not use change markup. Refer to default BREX rule BREX￾S1-00013 and BREX-S1-00036.

Generated TOC, LOT, LOF and references must not have changes applied or indicated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.2 Recording reasons for change

All elements that contain the change markup use a reason for update. Refer to Para 2.2 and
default BREX rule BREX-S1-00038. However, graphics and multimedia can also use a reason
for amendment. Refer to Para 2.3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.3 Linking reasons for update

The details of the changes made within the content section of a data module are recorded in
the identification and status section. Linking the change to the reason for change is achieved by
using the attribute reasonForUpdateRefIds of the element that is changed and the
attribute id of the element <reasonForUpdate>.
When the content of an element is changed, the value of its attribute 
reasonForUpdateRefIds is set to the same value as the attribute id of the element 
<reasonForUpdate>.

When the content of more than one element are affected by the same change, the value for
each of the elements' attribute reasonForUpdateRefIds are set to the same value as
the attribute id of the element <reasonForUpdate>.

When the content of more than one element is affected by different changes, the elements
affected by one change have the value for each of those elements’ attribute 
reasonForUpdateRefIds set to the same value as the attribute id of one occurrence
of the element <reasonForUpdate>. The elements affected by a different change have
the value for each of those elements’ attribute reasonForUpdateRefIds set to the
same value as the attribute id of a separate occurrence of the element 
<reasonForUpdate>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Reason for update

Description: The element <reasonForUpdate>, within the identification and status
section, records the reasons for developing and issuing the data module (issue number 001) or
the changes made to the data module since previous issue (ie, issue number 002 and
upwards). The element <reasonForUpdate> in data modules can be used to generate
the highlights data module. Examples of highlight statements are:
- New. Developed to support situation X
- Revised to incorporate modification XYZ
- Deleted. Data module no longer required

  
Markup element: <reasonForUpdate>

Attributes:
- applicRefId (O), the applicability information by referencing the element 
<applic>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.3.
- id (O), the identifier of the markup element. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.2.
- updateReasonType (O), indicates the type of the reason for update that it applies to,
and is configurable. Refer to Chap 3.9.6.1. If this attribute is not used, a technical change
is implied. The attribute can have one of the following values:
  • "urt01" - the changes are editorial (and therefore there must be no change markers
  in the data module that relate to this reason for update). There must be no technical
  changes in an element that relate to this reason for update.
  • "urt02" - the changes are technical. Provided that the data module is not revised,
  there must be change markers that relate to this reason for update.
  • "urt03" - the changes are related to markup only. If these changes affect the
  technical content of the data module, and the data module is of issue type changed,
  the changes that relate to this reason for update must be marked.
  • "urt04" - the changes are to applicability markings only. If these changes do not
  affect the technical content (or the issue type is other than changed), there must be no
  change markings in the data module that relate to this reason for update.
  • "urt05" - the changes are to referencing markings only. If these changes do not
  affect the technical content (or the issue type is other than changed), there must be no
  change markings in the data module that relate to this reason for update.
- updateHighlight (O), indicates whether the reason for update must appear in the
highlights data module. The attribute can have one of the following values:
  • "1"-Yes, the reason for update must appear in the highlights data module
  • "0" - No, the reason for update must not appear in the highlights data module
  Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00039.
- controlAuthorityRefs (O), the control authority information by referencing the
element <controlAuthority>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.1.

Child elements:
- <simplePara>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.10.
- <simpleRefPara>. Refer to Chap 3.9.5.2.1.10.

Note
  Both these elements are used to record the details of the change. Multiple occurrences
  of this element in a single occurrence of <reasonForUpdate> are not used to
  record individual changes made within the data module.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00089 - Standard sentences for reasons for
update:
– Decide whether standard sentences for reasons for update are to be used.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00090 - Use of reason for update in conjunction
with the production process:
– Decide whether the element <reasonForUpdate> is used during the production
process.

Business rule decision point BRDP-S1-00091 - Use of applicability information:
– Decide whether it is permissible to differentiate reasons for update based on Product
configuration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 Reason for amendment

Description: When the element <reasonForAmendment> is used, it records the reason
for the amendment to either a complete figure, or of individual illustration sheets 
of a multi￾sheet figure. The element can contain free text and/or its child elements 
to record the reason. 

If the change markup is used on the element <figure> then the 
change attributes on the element <graphic> of multi-sheet figures must not be used. 
Refer to default BREX rule BREX-S1-00043. This does not prevent the use of the element 
<reasonForAmendment> on a single illustration sheet of multi-sheet figures to indicate
changes in the illustration itself.

If change marking indication is required on individual illustration sheets of a multi-sheet figure,
then the appropriate change markup must be applied to the element <graphic>, and the
change markup on the element <figure> must not be used.
A single occurrence of the element <reasonForAmendment> is used for each individual
change.

The element <reasonForUpdate> that is referenced by the element <figure> or the
element <graphic> is used as described in Para 2.2, and contains general reasons why the
figure (or illustration sheet) has been added, modified or deleted.

2.4 Making changes to text

Text can be changed by changing a complete element or by changing the text within the
element, which is known as inline change. In both cases, the attribute issueType of the
element <dmStatus> is set to the value "changed".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4.1 Changing a complete element

When an element is added, modified or deleted, its change marking attribute values are set to
indicate the display requirements and the type of change.
All elements that contain the following attributes:


Attributes:

- changeMark (O), indicates whether the display of a change bar, mark or other visual
indication next to the entire content of an element being added, deleted or modified is
intended. The attribute can have one of the following values:
  • "1" - Yes, the display of a change bar, mark or other visual indication is intended
  • "0" - No, the display of a change bar, mark or other visual indication is not intended

Note
  If the attribute changeMark is not used, then there is no display of a change bar,
  mark or other visual indication intended.

- changeType (O), the type of the change. The attribute can have one of the following
values:
  • "add" - the element is added
  • "modify" - the element is changed
  • "delete" - the element is deleted

Note
  The attribute changeType can apply to any element and not especially to the
  element where the change occurs. Depending on the type of the change, propagation
  rules defining the change marking inheritance from the upper element to the lower can
  differ:
  - Elements marked with the value "modify" are allowed to contain elements
  marked with values "add", "modify" or "delete"
  - Elements marked with the value "delete": There is no need to set the change
  attributes on the element’s children because this is implied. Any change markings
  on child elements are ignored by the presentation system.
  - Elements marked with value "add": There is no need to set the change attributes
  on the element’s children because this is implied. Any change markings on child
  elements are ignored by the presentation system.

Note
  If this attribute is not used, and the attribute changeMark is used, the change is
  assumed to be an addition.

- reasonForUpdateRefIds (O), this attribute is used to link to the appropriate
occurrence of the element <reasonForUpdate>. Refer to Para 2.1.3.
